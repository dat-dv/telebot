# Feature Modules & Bounded Contexts

This directory contains specifications and domain knowledge organized by feature module / Bounded Context boundaries.

## Module Structure

Each subfolder under `modules/` represents a single feature module (e.g. `auth`, `homepage`, `platform-accounts`).

Each module document covers:
1. **Business Purpose & API Rationale**: Why specific APIs exist and what business problems they solve.
2. **Product & UI/UX Requirements**: Screen layout, responsive behavior (e.g. mobile drawer vs desktop buttons, required action triggers).
3. **Data Flow & Technical Seams**: Local state, DTO payload contracts, and integration points.
